# Procedure 
We will have a  3 step process  Data Pre-Processing, Model Building and Model Evaluation
We will use IMDB dataset to build bag of word model
First, we will import the training dataset
We will explore the data analysis 
Then we will use some cleanse data methodology 
After that, we will build a linear Support Vector classic model
Finally, we  are going to make performance metrics to determine accuracy, recall, precision, and f-1 score. 
# Data Pre-Processing 	
We are going to get our datasets from kaggle. 
https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. They provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing!

# Model Building 
We used Linear Support Vector Classifier to classify our data
The objective of a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) is to fit to the data you provide, returning a "best fit" hyperplane that divides, or categorizes, your data. From there, after getting the hyperplane, you can then feed some features to your classifier to see what the "predicted"
