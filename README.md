# Procedure 
We will have a  3 step process  Data Pre-Processing, Model Building and Model Evaluation
We will use IMDB dataset to build bag of word model
First, we will import the training dataset
We will explore the data analysis 
Then we will use some cleanse data methodology 
After that, we will build a linear Support Vector classic model
Finally, we  are going to make performance metrics to determine accuracy, recall, precision, and f-1 score. 
# Data Pre-Processing 	
We are going to get our datasets from kaggle. 
https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
